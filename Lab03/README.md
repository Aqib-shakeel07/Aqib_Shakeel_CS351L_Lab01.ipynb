 Employee Task Scheduling Using Degree Heuristic
This project simulates an employee task scheduling system where conflicts arise due to overlapping availabilities. The goal is to assign tasks to employees without conflicts using the Degree Heuristic for efficient task allocation.

Features

Graph Representation: Employees are nodes, and conflicts are edges between them.

Degree Heuristic: Prioritizes employees with the most conflicts for task assignment.

Backtracking: Ensures valid task assignment, with visualization at each step.

Visualization: Shows task assignments for employees in real-time.

How It Works

Enter the number of employees.

The system generates a random conflict graph.
Tasks are assigned using Degree Heuristic with backtracking.
The process is visualized step by step.

Requirements

Python 3.x
networkx and matplotlib libraries
